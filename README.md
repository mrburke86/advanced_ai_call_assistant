## List Conda Environments
To see a list of all your conda environments:

`conda env list`

## Activate a Conda Environment
To activate a conda environment:

`conda activate <env_name>`

Replace <env_name> with the name of the environment you want to activate. Once activated, you will see the environment's name in your terminal prompt, indicating that it is currently active.

## Deactivate a Conda Environment
To return to the base environment or deactivate any currently active environment:

`conda deactivate`

This command deactivates the current environment and returns you to the base environment. If you're already in the base environment, it will have no effect.
